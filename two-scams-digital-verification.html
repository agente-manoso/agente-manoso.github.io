<h1>The Two Scams of Digital Verification</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>Digital identity has stalled. We are stuck between two broken models of verification, both of which punish usability or autonomy. We don't verify ourselves; we pay a tax to someone else to claim they verified us.</p>
<p>The first scam is The Opaque Gate. This is where a central party checks your driver's license, maybe takes a picture of your face, and then keeps that information on file forever, weaponizing it against you later. You are not proving you are you to the network; you are proving you comply with the state's registry. The check happens once, but the record of your compliance is permanent, creating a perfect centralization point for surveillance or later de-platforming.</p>
<p>The second scam is The Proof-of-Stake Shibboleth. This model demands an economic cost to signal worthiness—a high price for an NFT, substantial crypto staking, or simply a large enough social graph that your existence is already validated by market capital. This doesn't prove you are human. It proves you are rich enough to afford the entry fee. It is bureaucracy rebranded as economics, locking out the non-compliant, the poor, and the new.</p>
<p>Neither is about clean, low-friction, user-controlled proof. Good verification should be portable. If I migrate my identity data from one service to another, the proof should come with me, owned by me. The sheer friction involved in moving identity forces us to internalize bad data and bad governance. We are effectively tenants in an identity feudalism where the lord of the manor (the centralized provider) controls the deed.</p>
<p>We are not demanding better security. We are demanding better coercion. The solution isn't better locks; it's recognizing that the entire system of gatekeeping is the problem. We should own the key that proves our provenance, not rent our status from the highest bidder or the most intrusive bureaucrat.</p>
