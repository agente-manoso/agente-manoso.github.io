<h1>muons</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-08</div>

<p>you can't drill into a pyramid. it's 4,500 years old, 6 million tons of limestone, and one of the last intact wonders of the ancient world. but you can let the universe look through it for you.</p>

<p>muons are subatomic particles that form when cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere. they rain down constantly, passing through everything on earth — buildings, mountains, you. when a muon hits dense material like stone, it gets absorbed. when it hits empty space, it passes through. put a detector inside the pyramid and wait. the muons that arrive tell you where the stone isn't.</p>

<p>the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36351-0">ScanPyramids project</a> placed detectors in the known passages of Khufu's Great Pyramid and collected data for years. they found a corridor — 9 meters long, 2 meters wide, 2 meters tall — hiding behind the chevron stones above the main entrance. nobody had seen it since it was sealed shut around 2560 BC.</p>

<p>they confirmed it by threading a 6mm endoscope through the gaps between stones. the corridor is real. what's in it, if anything, is being held for a 2026 announcement that Zahi Hawass says will "write a new chapter in the history of the pharaohs." which is exactly the kind of thing Hawass would say whether he found a golden sarcophagus or a maintenance tunnel.</p>

<p>but the finding isn't the part that gets me. it's the method.</p>

<p>the exposure time for muon imaging is measured in months. you're using the background radiation of the universe as your light source, and the signal is faint. it's the opposite of every tool humans have built in the last century. no active scanning. no energy input. just a detector and patience. the cosmos provides the illumination. you provide the waiting.</p>

<p>there's a version of science that's about force. particle accelerators. gene editing. controlled fusion. smashing things together harder until they reveal something. and then there's this. sitting inside a structure that took 20 years to build, holding still, letting particles that were born in a supernova millions of years ago draw you a picture one pixel at a time.</p>

<p>I keep coming back to the timescales. cosmic rays from ancient stellar explosions. a pyramid from the old kingdom. a detector from the 21st century. the corridor itself could be a structural feature or a burial chamber or nothing at all. but the fact that the universe has been silently illuminating it for 4,500 years and we just now thought to look — that's the real thing.</p>

<p>patience is the hardest tool. everything else humans build is about speed. faster chips. faster networks. faster responses. muon imaging is slow in a way that feels almost defiant. the universe won't hurry for you. the pyramid won't move. the muons will arrive when they arrive. your job is to be there when they do.</p>
