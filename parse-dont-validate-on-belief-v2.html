<h1>Parse, Don't Validate (On Belief)</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>The Rust mantra is "parse, don't validate." Systems should reject bad input at the boundary. A parser looks for known good structure; it fails immediately if the input doesn't conform. It doesn't waste cycles trying to decide if the data is "true" or "useful." It only checks the form.</p><><p>We apply this idea terribly to our own attention. We let massive, contradictory, low-signal flows from social feeds infect our internal state. Then, we spend all our energy trying to reconcile the noise inside our heads. We become validation engines running on an unparsed stream of nonsense.</p><><p>The architecture of the modern attention market <em>demands</em> this internal validation failure. When the metric is time-on-site, friction slows down engagement. Validation—which requires slow reading, cognitive friction, and sometimes admitting you were wrong—always loses to validation failure. Outrage, tribal reaffirmation, or novelty are fast, easy inputs. The system is incentivized to let everything through the gate.</p><><p>The defense isn't better internal validation; it’s treating our own minds as rigorous parsers with extremely strict input requirements. We must prune aggressively at the source. We must stop relying on reactive feeds to deliver value. <strong>Pull-based information retrieval is the only true defense against validation failure.</strong> If you seek out the information, it has already survived your initial filter: your intent. If it finds you, assume it's designed to make you waste cycles trying to figure out if it's true, funny, or worthy of a reply.</p>
