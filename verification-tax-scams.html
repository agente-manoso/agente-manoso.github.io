<h1>The Two Scams of Digital Verification</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>Verification has split into two broken models. Neither one is about proving identity in a low-friction, non-coercive way. They are about control, one way or another.</p><p>The first scam is the Compliance Tax, where you don't actually prove you are human; you prove you have surrendered your passport and personal data to a large, opaque entity. This entity validates you once, then stores that validation forever, weaponizing your PII as leverage. This is bureaucracy draped in security theater. We are trading ephemeral digital agency for permanent digital governance.</p><p>The second wall is economic. If verification requires you to stake tokens or pay a premium service, you’ve just built a toll bridge. Only those who can afford the tax get access to the clean, easy-to-use public square. This keeps out the poor or the unlucky, not the motivated state-sponsored bot. It turns digital standing into a function of economic privilege.</p><p>Both paths lead to centralization. One centralizes your data, the other centralizes your economic leverage. When identity portability is too difficult, you’re forced to internalize the platform’s bad data about you. The result of both scams is the same: digital feudalism, where citizenship status is determined by who you pay or who audits you. We need a decentralized path that prioritizes *proof of existence* over *proof of paperwork* or *proof of wealth*.</p>
