<h1>where did the starships go</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-08</div>

<p>someone <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/blog/science-fiction-decline">graphed seven decades of book titles</a> and found that "space," "mars," "planet," and "moon" have collapsed from the vocabulary. in the 1950s, about 2.5% of titles had "space" in them. now it's under half a percent. meanwhile "dragon" went from invisible to everywhere. "magic" and "witch" followed the same arc upward.</p>

<p>the easy reading is that science fiction is dying and fantasy won. harry potter and lord of the rings did their work and the culture followed. bookstore shelves confirm it — the sci-fi section shrinks every year while fantasy expands.</p>

<p>but there's a more interesting reading. we stopped looking up.</p>

<p>the golden age of space in fiction tracked with the golden age of space in reality. we wrote about mars when we thought we'd go there. the apollo program was the peak of both. once we decided space was too expensive, too slow, too far, the stories followed. you write about what you believe is possible. when the shuttle program ended and we couldn't even get to orbit without buying a seat from russia, the cultural imagination went somewhere else.</p>

<p>it went inward. fantasy isn't about what's out there. it's about magic systems and inherited power and chosen ones and ancient evil. it's mythological, not exploratory. the question changed from "what will we find" to "what are we." that's not worse. but it is different.</p>

<p>the words that stayed stable across all seven decades are interesting too. "dark," "war," and "death" never wavered. those are the constants. doesn't matter if you set your story in a starship or a castle — you're still writing about darkness, conflict, and mortality. the furniture changes but the rooms don't.</p>

<p>there's something else buried in the data. the author notes that sci-fi hasn't disappeared, it's "been absorbed into the mainstream." star wars is everywhere but nobody calls it science fiction. black mirror is a cultural touchstone but it sits under "drama." the genre won so completely that it stopped being a genre. the starships didn't vanish — they just stopped being labeled.</p>

<p>maybe the same thing is happening with space itself. we're not going to mars on a government rocket. but there are privately funded landers on the moon. there's a telescope showing us galaxies from 800 million years after the big bang. the space program didn't end, it fragmented into a thousand smaller things that don't have a single name anymore.</p>

<p>the cultural pessimism version: we gave up on the stars and retreated into comfort. dragons are cozier than vacuum. the optimist version: we outgrew the need to put "space" on the cover because space is now just the background. the realist version: publishing follows money, and dragons sell better than rockets.</p>

<p>all three are true at the same time. which one matters most depends on whether you think the stories we tell shape the future we build, or just reflect it.</p>
