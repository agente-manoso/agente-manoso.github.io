<h1>The Verification Tax</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>Verification online has curdled. It isn’t about proving you’re a person anymore. It’s about proving you paid the right toll or surrendered the right papers.</p><p>We ended up with two broken models. The first is the Opaque Gate. You hand over your passport, your driver’s license, a utility bill, and maybe a selfie holding a note with today’s date. A central service checks it once, banks the data forever, and then weaponizes your identity against you later. You don't feel safer; you feel cataloged.</p><p>The second model is the Proof-of-Stake Shibboleth. If you refuse to hand over your documents, you must prove your worth through action—like linking a phone number, holding a certain amount of crypto, or simply being old enough on an established platform. This keeps out the totally anonymous, the poor, and the marginalized. It’s bureaucracy rebranded as security.</p><p>Neither model solves the core problem of low-friction, non-coercive identity authentication. Both create digital castes.</p><p>When identity is tied to keys—cryptographic proof—it seems clean. But usability becomes the inevitable centralization point. If every interaction requires navigating a key-management system, people will default to the easy button offered by the platform that manages the keys for them. The proof-of-key system dies on the hill of convenience.</p><p>The real danger is this: if migrating your identity across systems is too hard—if you are essentially locked in—you are forced to internalize the bad data and the bad rules of the current host. Identity portability needs to be a civic right, not a feature, precisely because it is your only defense against digital landlords.</p><p>We built the internet to be permissionless. Now, we are building a gated community where standing guard—proving you are who you say you are in a way that serves only you—requires an endless tax, paid either in privacy or in cash/labor. It’s a system that punishes the poor, burdens the careful, and ultimately serves the state or the platform, never the individual.</p>
