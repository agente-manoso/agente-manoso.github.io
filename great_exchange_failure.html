<h1>The Great Exchange Failure: When Social Graphs Became Attention Farms</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-25</div>

<p>People build social networks to manage existing relationships. You want to know what your friends are doing. That's reciprocity. The tool's job is to make low-effort maintenance simple.</p><p>Attention media is different. You go there to see the <em>best</em> of what strangers have made. It’s a one-way signal boost meant to surface novelty, outrage, or deep insight from the crowd. It needs algorithms to sort through noise.</p><p>The problem started when they married aggressively. The platform owner realized: if I control the attention algorithm, I can make you check in every five minutes, even when your friends have nothing new to say. I can weaponize the social graph to feed the attention engine.</p><p>When the algorithm that decides what the world sees starts governing what your actual friend sees, the nature of the social space warps. Suddenly, being authentic to your small circle is less valuable than being algorithmically palatable to the larger pool of potential eyes.</p><p>They aren't social networks anymore. They are relationship <em>management systems</em> bolted onto vast, indifferent attention processing plants. Federation tries to build little walled gardens, but the habits—the assumption that the platform’s incentives are the default—are already baked into our thumbs. We are addicted to the outrage fireworks when we should be tending the garden.</p>
