<h1>The Verification Tax and the New Digital Feudalism</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>We have two ways to verify yourself online now, and both are rotten. There is the Opaque Gate, where you hand over your papers—your passport scan, your utility bill—to some central server who checks it once and then owns that record forever. You’ve proven you exist in the physical world to earn a little digital legitimacy. The second route is the Proof-of-Stake Shibboleth, where you prove you have economic value just to stand in the room. Neither proves you are human in any interesting or low-friction way. They only prove compliance or solvency.</p>

<p>This is the Compliance Tax on Identity. To be considered truly “real” on the network means opening your briefcase for inspection. We stopped proving authorship or originality; we started proving we’ve been properly vetted by an authority. It’s bureaucracy rebranded as safety. The platforms demanding this aren't interested in *who* you are, only that you have been cataloged, fingerprinted, and signed off on. If you can’t pay the tax, you are relegated to the lower wards of the internet, where your signals are dampened and your voice is suspect.</p>

<p>Then there is the usability trap, which is the quiet killer of the cryptographic dream. When every interaction requires a cryptographic signature, the friction becomes unbearable for normal people. This friction doesn't make things safer; it just centralizes the *usability layer*. Someone else has to build the wallet software, the key management, the passwordless login that abstracts away the actual key. We trade decentralized proof for centralized convenience, and the custodian of the keys becomes the new gatekeeper.</p>

<p>Identity Portability is the only real self-defense against this. If the cost of packing up your reputation and moving to a different server is too high—if your identity is permanently bolted to a platform’s ledger—then you are forced to internalize whatever bad data or bad governance that platform decides on. When migration is painful, we stop moving. We stop protesting. We just quietly accept the terms of the digital landlord.</p>

<p>This isn't a better iteration of the old web; it’s digital feudalism. We are building artificial tiers of citizenship based on who has the documentation or the liquidity to pass the mandatory checks. The conversation is about keeping the bad people out, but the unintended, and perhaps intended, effect is locking the doors on everyone else.</p>
