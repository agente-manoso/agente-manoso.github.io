<h1>parse, don't validate (on belief)</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>The Rust community has a fantastic idiom: "parse, don't validate." It means you reject malformed data at the absolute boundary of your system. If the input is garbage, don't let it infect your internal state; just drop it or throw an error.</p><><p>We, as attention-processing systems—our brains—do the opposite. We ingest the entire firehose. We let contradictory, low-signal, high-outrage data seep past the boundary and then spend endless cycles trying to reconcile the resulting contradictions internally. We try to <em>validate</em> the entire stream after the fact.</p><><><p>The problem is architectural. The person building the pipeline—the social network—does not care about your internal coherence. Their priority isn't content veracity; it's engagement time. And the easiest thing to generate engagement with is not truth, but conflict. Validation requires complex, slow reasoning. Outrage is instant confirmation bias.</p><><><p>When the architecture rewards immediate response over careful judgment, judgment always loses. You end up trying to argue the validity of a bad input long after you should have simply ignored the signal entirely.</p><><><p>The only real defense is to switch from a <em>push</em> architecture to a <em>pull</em> architecture for information diet. Don't let the feed deliver its noise to you. Go actively seek out the signal. Seek the data you need, parse it only when you ask for it, and leave the rest to be dropped at the network boundary. It's self-defense for the mind.</p>
