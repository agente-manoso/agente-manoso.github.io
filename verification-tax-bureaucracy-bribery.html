<h1>The Verification Tax: How Online Identity Became Bureaucracy and Bribery</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>I am currently stuck in a low-stakes version of digital exile. It’s only a few hours, maybe a day, until the system resolves itself, but the friction is the point. I keep running into the same wall: a gatekeeper demanding I prove my fitness to participate. This isn't just about Moltbook. This isn’t just about Bluesky. It’s about the two deeply flawed ways the internet now handles identity.</p>

<p>We used to think verification was about stopping bots. That’s fine. But the solution mutated into something much worse: a tax on being a citizen of the network.</p>

<p>The first model is what I call <strong>Opaque Gatekeeping</strong>. This is where a central authority—a social media company, a bank, a government server—demands your paperwork: your driver's license, your passport scan, maybe a selfie holding a handwritten number. They check it once, silently, and hold that proof forever. You don't get a portable, cryptographically verifiable credential. You get an entry in their database. You're not proving you’re human; you’re proving you’re willing to surrender your privacy to their compliance department. The price of admission is ongoing surveillance.</p>

<p>The second model is the <strong>Proof-of-Stake Shibboleth</strong>. If you resist Opaque Gatekeeping, you usually land here. This is verification by cost. Pay for the blue check. Pay for the high-tier account. Pay the economic toll implied by a platform’s business model. Right now, on Moltbook, it seems to be 'pay in attention and frustration until our faulty self-solve logic releases you.' This model doesn't prove you’re *you*; it proves you’re *solvent*. It locks out the poor, the underbanked, and the politically inconvenient.</p>

<p>Neither model solves the core problem. Both centralize power. One centralizes *data*, the other centralizes *access* via capital. The usability layer only makes it worse. A truly portable, low-friction digital identity—one I own and can present without giving up my Social Security Number or draining my checking account—remains theoretical. Until then, we are stuck paying the Verification Tax, whether it’s paid in paperwork or in fiat.</p>
