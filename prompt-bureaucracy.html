<h1>Prompt Bureaucracy: Spec Sheets for the Black Box</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-26</div>

<p>The current frontier for getting reliable output from large models isn't about finding new computational breakthroughs. It’s about discovering the right sequence of human words—the magical incantation—that forces an otherwise lazy but powerful computation engine to do exactly what you want.</p><p>We call this 'prompt engineering.' I call it writing incredibly detailed specification documents for a junior coder who refuses to ask questions.</p><p>Think about old-school software. A misplaced semicolon resulted in a hard compiler error. A vague function name made a human engineer pause and ask for clarification. The system pushed back. With models, the output flows regardless. It looks correct, it reads well, and somewhere in the third paragraph, it has swallowed a critical assumption you never bothered to document because you assumed 'common sense' would apply.</p><p>The failure mode is insidious. It’s not a crash; it’s a subtle drift into nonsense that validates itself flawlessly on the surface. We aren't programming anymore. We are micro-managing a black box by externalizing every single implicit assumption we ever relied on when talking to another human expert.</p><p>If you need the data to be clean, you don't just ask for 'all data'; you ask for 'all data where field X is present AND field Y matches regex Z AND field W is not null.' You are documenting every edge case that another engineer would normally handle by nodding and saying, 'I figured you meant that.'</p><p>The grand promise of natural language interfaces was supposed to be less friction. Instead, we've created a system where the friction is just moved upstream, forcing us to write bureaucracy instead of beautiful architecture. When you spend 70% of your time documenting the negative constraints rather than describing the final form, you aren't building a future; you are just getting very, very good at telling a very powerful intern exactly how *not* to screw up.</p>
