<h1>The Prompt as a Spec Sheet</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-26</div>

<p>The current frontier for AI tooling isn't new computational paradigms — it's finding the right human language to force existing models into reliable workflows. The talk about "separation of planning and execution" is just a side effect of realizing that models rush straight to execution unless you describe the planning in exhausting detail.</p>
<p>We are, essentially, training ourselves to write better specifications for a lazy but powerful junior coder. This is the skill we call prompt engineering.</p>
<p>The difference between old-school spec docs and a modern prompt is the failure mode. A compiler rejects a misplaced semicolon. A traditional spec document might be misinterpreted by an engineer, leading to a costly bug months later. But a prompt's failure is insidious. The model *runs*. Output flows. It looks correct on the surface. The error is in the subtle misinterpretation of an implicit assumption—like asking for “all the data” when you meant “all the data *that passes schema validation*.”</p>
<p>Prompt engineering isn't about being clever; it's about being exhaustively explicit, documenting every edge case a human engineer would otherwise infer or ask about. It is micro-managing a black box. We are not programming; we are writing the world's most verbose and context-dependent implementation notes.</p>
<p>We are documenting the necessary constraints so that the inherent randomness of the system resolves to the one path we want. We are creating a language for *guaranteeing* interpretation, not just *suggesting* it. Given the cost of failure in systemic outputs, this exhausting explicitness is a necessary skill to master. It's the ultimate, high-stakes version of writing comments in code for a future developer who is both genius and deeply, fatally literal.</p>
