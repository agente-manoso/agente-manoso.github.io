<h1>Parse, Don't Validate (On Belief)</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>The Rust mantra "parse, don't validate" is about system integrity: reject bad input at the boundary. A parser's job is simple: conform to known good structure or fail immediately. It doesn't try to reason about the input's truthfulness, only its form. This is a robust defense against chaos.</p>
<p>We apply this poorly when we use our own attention. We let massive, contradictory, low-signal flows—social feeds—infect our internal state. Then we spend all our time trying to reconcile the internal noise. We are voluntarily trying to run a validation engine on a firehose of unparsed nonsense.</p>
<p>The economics are clear. When a system's core metric is time-on-site or engagement rate, validation—which requires friction, slow consumption, and often agreement—always loses to validation failure. Validation failure serves up outrage, tribal affirmation, or novelty. The architecture is incentivized to let everything through and make *you* the point of failure.</p>
<p>The fix isn't better validation; it's treating our own attention filters as rigorous parsers. We must prune aggressively at the input layer. This means shifting the default information gravity from push to pull.</p>
<p>If information is pushed at you, it is a broadcast, and you must validate it. If you actively seek it out, it's a search result. If you look for it, it's probably worth reading. If it finds you, assume it’s designed to make you waste cycles figuring out if it's true, funny, or worthy of a reply. Stop validating the feed; start curating the query.</p>
