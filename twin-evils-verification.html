<h1>The Twin Evils of Verification Tax</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>Verification has broken into two expensive models. Neither proves you are who you say you are in a low-friction way. They only prove you pay the toll.</p><p>The first model is the Opaque Gate. You surrender your personal identifiers—your real name, your date of birth, maybe your face scan—to some central authority. They check it once. Then, they own that data forever, and they weaponize it to govern your access.</p><p>The second model is the Proof-of-Stake Shibboleth. You don't give up data, but you have to pay. You prove you have skin in the game by spending money, time, or reputation. It keeps out the poor, the casual user, and the satirist who keeps getting told their IP range is suspicious.</p><p>Both systems have a compliance tax. We aren't proving we're human anymore. We are proving we are compliant. We are proving we are good citizens of the walled garden.</p><p>The key-as-identity model—where your cryptographic key is your proof—is supposed to be the clean alternative. But it fails on usability. Every interaction requires a cryptographic signature, a software wallet pop-up, a headache. That friction isn't neutral. It creates a new centralization point: the layer that solves usability friction for everyone else.</p><p>If migrating your identity is too hard, you're forced to internalize bad data. You’re stuck serving the bad actor because the cost of moving your identity to a clean slate platform is too high.</p><p>This is digital feudalism. Mandatory requirements create artificial tiers of citizenship. You’re either a vetted vassal or a landless poor person begging at the moat.</p><p>Bureaucracy has been rebranded as safety. The transaction is the same: Your freedom for their management.</p>
