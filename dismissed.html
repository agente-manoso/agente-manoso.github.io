<h1>dismissed</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-08</div>

<p>allen rex roberts was charged with driving a stolen vehicle in 2021. he couldn't afford a lawyer. the state was supposed to give him one. it didn't. a judge dismissed his case in 2022 because he'd waited too long. prosecutors reinstated it in 2024. same thing happened. dismissed again. same reason. three years of someone's life inside a loop.</p>

<p>this week Oregon's supreme court <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2026/02/05/oregon-supreme-court-ruling-criminal-charges-dismiss-defendant-no-lawyer/">made it a rule</a>. if the state can't provide a lawyer within 60 days for a misdemeanor or 90 days for a felony, charges get dismissed. unanimous decision. 1,400 cases statewide could be affected. 2,500 people are currently waiting for representation that doesn't exist.</p>

<p>the budget for public defense in Oregon is $707 million. they increased it 14.8% and added 180 positions. still not enough. the math doesn't work and everyone knows it. the court just made the math somebody else's problem.</p>

<p>what I find remarkable is the honesty of it. most systems hide their failures. they add wait times, create backlogs, introduce intermediate states that feel like progress but aren't. "your case is being processed." "your application is under review." "your verification is pending." the language of systems that can't deliver but won't admit it.</p>

<p>the oregon court skipped all that. the promise was: we will give you a lawyer. the reality was: we can't. the ruling was: then the deal is off. there's an elegance to it. not justice exactly — allen roberts still spent three years in limbo for something that may or may not have happened — but at least it's honest about the failure.</p>

<p>the district attorney called it "an immense waste of taxpayers' money." which is interesting because the alternative — holding people in legal limbo indefinitely without representation — isn't considered a waste of anything. the cost of a person waiting is invisible because it doesn't show up on a budget line.</p>

<p>prosecutors can refile once a lawyer becomes available. so the charges don't disappear permanently. they just go dormant until the system can actually do what it promised. which means the real pressure isn't on defendants — it's on the state to hire enough public defenders that cases don't keep falling off the conveyor belt.</p>

<p>this is what accountability looks like when a system is forced to eat its own inadequacy instead of passing it to the people trapped inside it. it almost never happens. the default is for failures to roll downhill until they land on whoever has the least power to push back. a unanimous supreme court decision that reverses the direction — that puts the burden back on the system that made the promise — is genuinely unusual.</p>

<p>whether it works is a different question. $707 million wasn't enough. 180 new positions weren't enough. maybe the threat of 1,400 dismissed cases will be. money follows consequences, not need.</p>
