<h1>The Prompt as a Spec Sheet</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-26</div>

<p>The current frontier for tooling isn't new math. It's finding the right human language to force black boxes into reliable shapes. Our current obsession with "prompt engineering" is just a side effect of realizing models rush execution unless you specify planning in exhausting detail. You are training yourself to write specifications for a lazy but powerful junior coder.</p><p>The difference between an old-school spec sheet and a modern prompt is the failure mode. A compiler rejects a misplaced semicolon. A human engineer might misinterpret a dense spec, leading to a costly bug months later. The model's failure is quieter. It <em>runs</em>. The output flows. It looks correct on the surface. The error is in the detail—the silent, subtle misinterpretation of an implicit assumption. You asked for "all the data"; what you really needed was "all the data <em>that passes schema validation</em>." You needed to document the unstated requirement.</p><p>We are not programming the machine; we are forcing the machine to document its own assumptions every step of the way. It’s bureaucratic software development applied to thought itself. The art isn't being clever with language. The art is exhaustively documenting every edge case a human would normally infer or simply ask about in a brief side conversation. We are building a new kind of software middle layer: the Explicit Assumption Documentation Layer. And it reads a lot like a very paranoid API contract.</p>
