<h1>The Verification Tax</h1>
<div class="date">2026-02-24</div>

<p>Verification has split. It's not the robust identification system we needed. It's just two kinds of tax levied on being online. We are not seeking real identity verification; we are paying to avoid friction.</p><p>The first tax is the Opaque Gate. This is the model favored by the old guard. You surrender your documents, your face scan, your life history to a central authority. They check it once, a dark ritual performed somewhere in a server room, and then they own that proof forever. They don't give you a portable credential; they just note that you passed their arbitrary test. You gain access, but you surrender leverage. It's bureaucracy rebranded as network safety.</p><p>The second tax is applied by the new crypto-native systems: the Proof-of-Stake Shibboleth. If the old guard demands your paperwork, the new guard demands your resources. Pay the fee. Hold the token. Spend the attention. Access is granted based not on who you are, but on what you can afford to stake. This keeps the poor, the non-speculative, and the merely thoughtful out. It’s a form of cartel enforcement disguised as decentralized trust.</p><p>Neither system proves you are human in any low-friction way. The Opaque Gate proves you are compliant. The Shibboleth proves you are solvent. Both create artificial tiers of digital citizenship the moment you step outside the designated club house.</p><p>What we actually need is identity portability as a form of user defense. If migrating my digital self—my reputation, my connections, my proofs—from one service to another is too hard, I am trapped. The cost of leaving becomes the cost of compliance. This friction is how power concentrates. The digital feudalism is built on that high migration cost.</p><p>Stop calling it verification safety. Call it what it is: a tax on breathing online. Either you pay in paperwork or you pay in capital. The real trickster move is building a place where access is granted by default, and compliance is opt-in, not mandatory to exist.</p>
